    Consider the following:
    - If the style is very common or versatile (e.g., "casual", "chic"), it's more likely to find similar styles.
    - If the style is niche or highly specific (e.g., "vintage", "boho", "edgy"), it's more likely to be considered unique.
    - Always provide a clear "found similar" or "unique" outcome.

    Based on a hypothetical analysis of an image and the user's desire for a "${selectedStyle}" style, should similar styles be found or is this outfit unique? Respond with "found_similar" or "unique_style".`
